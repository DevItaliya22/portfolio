    'Full-stack analytics dashboard for startup company. Handled API development, frontend optimization, and AWS deployment during 2-month internship.',
  longDescription: `Delfa Innovators was my comprehensive internship project where I developed an enterprise-level analytics dashboard for a growing startup company.

## Project Overview:
**Delfa Innovators** needed a centralized dashboard to visualize company data, track analytics, and monitor business performance. I was responsible for the complete development cycle from backend APIs to frontend optimization.

## Key Responsibilities:

### Full-Stack Development
- **API Architecture**: Designed and implemented multiple RESTful APIs for data management
- **Frontend Optimization**: Enhanced React performance with modern optimization techniques
- **Database Management**: Structured and optimized PostgreSQL queries for analytics

### Technical Implementation
- **File Processing System**: Built robust PDF and Excel handling with AWS S3 integration
- **Real-time Analytics**: Implemented live data visualization and monitoring dashboards
- **Code Migration**: Successfully migrated JavaScript codebase to TypeScript for better maintainability

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS Deployment**: Managed complete deployment pipeline on AWS EC2
- **S3 Integration**: Implemented secure file storage and processing workflows
- **Production Ready**: Delivered a scalable, production-ready application

## Collaboration:
Worked alongside [@Aviral](https://github.com/AviralJ58) from Accenture, handling both frontend and backend responsibilities while maintaining high code quality standards.

## Results:
Successfully completed the project in **2 months** with the dashboard now live and actively used by the company for business intelligence and decision-making processes.`,
