    'Improved Raycast extension for WhatsApp with automatic macOS contact integration and smart recent contact sorting. Solves major UX issues in the original extension.',
  longDescription: `A significantly **enhanced Raycast extension** for WhatsApp that transforms the user experience by automating contact management and providing intelligent contact sorting.

## Problem Solved:
The [original Raycast WhatsApp extension](https://www.raycast.com/vimtor/whatsapp) required users to **manually add every contact** one by one, creating a poor user experience and scalability issues for users with many contacts.

## Innovation & Improvements:

### Automatic Contact Integration
- **macOS Contacts Sync**: Automatically fetches contacts from the user's macOS address book
- **Zero Manual Setup**: No need to manually add contacts one by one
- **Seamless Integration**: Works immediately after installation with existing contacts

### Smart Contact Management
- **Recent Contacts First**: Intelligently shows most recently contacted people at the top
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Contacts automatically reorder based on usage patterns
- **Enhanced Search**: Improved contact search and filtering capabilities

### Superior User Experience
- **One-Time Setup**: Install once and it works for lifetime - no ongoing maintenance
- **Scalable Solution**: Handles hundreds of contacts without manual intervention
- **Instant Access**: Quick WhatsApp chat access directly from Raycast

## Technical Implementation:

### macOS Integration
- **Contacts API**: Deep integration with macOS Contacts framework
- **Permission Handling**: Proper contact access permissions and privacy controls
- **Real-time Sync**: Automatic updates when contacts change

### Smart Algorithms
- **Usage Tracking**: Tracks contact interaction frequency for intelligent sorting
- **Recent Activity**: Prioritizes recently messaged contacts for quick access
- **Search Optimization**: Enhanced search algorithms for fast contact discovery

## Open Source Contribution:

### Community Impact
- **[Pull Request #19727](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/pull/19727)**: Submitted improvements to official Raycast extensions repository
- **Recognition**: Maintainers acknowledged the improvements and plan to integrate similar features
- **Developer Collaboration**: Worked with [@vimtor](https://github.com/vimtor) and Raycast team on potential integration

### Why PR Wasn't Merged:
- Documentation complications and initial misunderstandings
- Raycast team decided to implement similar improvements in their own way
- **Validation**: Maintainers confirmed the approach was superior and would update their code accordingly

## User Impact:
- **Eliminates Friction**: Removes the tedious process of manually adding contacts
- **Improves Productivity**: Instant access to WhatsApp chats from Raycast
- **Better Organization**: Smart sorting puts relevant contacts at fingertips
- **Scales Seamlessly**: Works equally well for users with 10 or 1000+ contacts

## Technical Stack:
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for reliability
- **Raycast API**: Deep integration with Raycast's extension framework
- **macOS APIs**: Native contact system integration
- **Smart Caching**: Efficient contact data management

## Community Recognition:
- **2 GitHub Stars**: Community appreciation for the improved solution
- **Developer Acknowledgment**: Official maintainers recognized the superior approach
- **Real-world Usage**: Developers can immediately clone, install, and benefit from the improvements
